## üè¢ **Firm Setup Process (After Payment)**

### **Step 1: Payment & Account Creation**
1. **Payment Processing**: Firm completes subscription purchase through Stripe
2. **Firm Account Creation**: System automatically creates:
   - Unique firm ID (`firm_123abc`)
   - Firm database tenant with RLS (Row Level Security)
   - Secure document storage folder (`documents/firm-123abc/`)
   - Billing account linkage

### **Step 2: Primary Administrator Setup**
```typescript
// Automatic process after payment
{
  firmId: "firm_123abc",
  firmName: "Smith & Associates Law",
  domain: "smithlaw.com",
  subscription: "professional", // starter, professional, enterprise
  adminUser: {
    name: "John Smith",
    email: "admin@smithlaw.com",
    role: "admin",
    permissions: ["full_access"]
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Onboarding Wizard**
The firm administrator goes through a 6-step setup wizard:

1. **Firm Information**
   - Firm name, domain, size, practice areas
   - Used for branding and configuration

2. **Admin Account Setup**
   - Primary administrator details
   - Full system permissions granted

3. **SSO Integration (Optional)**
   - Azure AD, Okta, Auth0, or SAML setup
   - Enterprise-grade single sign-on

4. **User Management Strategy**
   - Manual user creation
   - CSV bulk import
   - Active Directory sync

5. **Data Migration**
   - Case and client import
   - Document upload
   - Migration assistance options

6. **Platform Configuration**
   - Workflow settings
   - AI preferences
   - Role definitions

## üîê **Sign Up vs. Sign In: Key Differences**

## üë• **User Onboarding Options**

### **Option 1: Manual User Addition**
**Best for:** Small firms (1-20 users)

**Process:**
1. Admin navigates to Users ‚Üí Add User
2. Fills in user details:
   ```typescript
   {
     name: "Sarah Johnson",
     email: "sarah@smithlaw.com", // Must match firm domain
     role: "partner", // admin, partner, associate, paralegal, client
     department: "Corporate Law",
     sendInvite: true
   }
   ```
3. System sends invitation email
4. User clicks invite link and creates password
5. Immediate access to firm's platform

**Admin Interface:**
- Add User button
- Role selection dropdown
- Department assignment
- Automatic invitation sending

### **Option 2: CSV Bulk Import**
**Best for:** Medium firms (20-100 users)

**Process:**
1. Admin downloads CSV template
2. Fills in user information:
   ```csv
   Name,Email,Role,Department,Title
   Sarah Johnson,sarah@smithlaw.com,partner,Corporate Law,Senior Partner
   Michael Chen,michael@smithlaw.com,associate,Litigation,Associate Attorney
   Emily Davis,emily@smithlaw.com,paralegal,Corporate Law,Legal Assistant
   ```
3. Uploads CSV file
4. System validates data and shows preview
5. Bulk invitation emails sent
6. Users receive personalized setup links

**Features:**
- Data validation (email domain checking)
- Duplicate detection
- Role mapping
- Batch processing
- Progress tracking

### **Option 3: Active Directory Integration**
**Best for:** Large firms (100+ users) with existing IT infrastructure

**Setup Requirements:**
- Azure AD or on-premises Active Directory
- SCIM 2.0 or Graph API access
- SSO configuration completed first

**Automatic User Provisioning:**
```typescript
// AD Sync Configuration
{
  adDomain: "smithlaw.onmicrosoft.com",
  syncEnabled: true,
  userMapping: {
    "CN=Partners,DC=smithlaw,DC=com": "partner",
    "CN=Associates,DC=smithlaw,DC=com": "associate",
    "CN=Paralegals,DC=smithlaw,DC=com": "paralegal"
  },
  syncSchedule: "daily", // real-time, hourly, daily
  autoDeprovisioning: true
}
```

**Sync Process:**
1. **Real-time Provisioning**: New AD users automatically get platform accounts
2. **Role Mapping**: AD group membership determines platform roles
3. **Attribute Sync**: Name, email, department, title synchronized
4. **Deprovisioning**: Disabled AD users lose platform access
5. **First Login**: Users sign in with corporate credentials, account auto-created
